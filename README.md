This homework focuses on applying survival analysis techniques to understand the factors influencing customer churn in a telecom dataset.
The dataset contains various features such as subscriber ID, region, tenure, age, marital status, income, education level, retirement status, gender, and service usage indicators like voice, internet, and call forwarding.

Key Objectives:
- Build AFT models with different parametric distributions.
- Compare the performance of the models.
- Visualize survival curves for all models.
- Interpret the coefficients of the final model.
- Identify valuable customer segments based on CLV.
- Provide suggestions for retention strategies based on the findings.

This project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting churn risk and guide decision-making for customer retention efforts in the telecom industry.
